## Instructions

Step 1: Check the Supported Language table above and see what languages you think that needs to be translated.

Step 2: Refer to the language code provided by the Extension API documentation https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n

Step 3: 

- Adding New Language

    - For example, if you want to add `French`. Create a new folder in `_locales` and name it as `fr` (refer to language code in Step 2). Inside the `fr` folder, create a new JSON file and name it as `messages.json`. Then go to the `en` folder and copy the entire content of `messages.json` into your localized file. 
    
    - OR you can skip that and just copy the `en` folder and rename it yourself and then make your translations in the `messages.json` file. 

- Updating an Existing Language

    - Clone this repository and then go to the `_locales` folder. Find the language that you want to edit. Once you are finished, kindly submit a Pull Request.
