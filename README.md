**Automatically rename downloaded images from the internet**

This Chromium extension is designed to automatically rename files using custom parameters to keep your files more organized. Normally, when you download files from the internet, file names are often scrambled with random words and numbers that don't mean anything. 

At the moment, this extension only supports Twitter. The screenshots below is an example of how this extension works. 

**BEFORE**

Using the default "Save image as" option in Microsoft Edge.

![autorename-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24803220/55883799-893cba00-5bd9-11e9-8843-4c065939243b.png)

**AFTER**

Using the extension "Save image as (AutoRename)" in Microsoft Edge.

`[@][Twitter username] [Tweet ID] [Random string].`

These parameters can be customized in the Extension Options.
